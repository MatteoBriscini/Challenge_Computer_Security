# Mission 0 ~ SQL injection
## Goal and instructions
We have implemented a new version of our web app. It is badly designed, and implemented even worse, but you can go on and test it! P.S. One of our not-so-experienced developers has wiped the users table and we have lost all data, but we should have a copy somewhere in the database :). Can you retrieve the password of user Jacquelyn?
