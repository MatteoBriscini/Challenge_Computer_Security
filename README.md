## University

Politecnico di Milano.

Academic Year: 2023/2024.

055633 - Computer Security - UIC 587 - professor Zanero Stefano - security challenge.



## Specification

This GitHub repository describes how to attack some C code and some vulnerable websites in the form of challenges.
<br>
The challenges were carried out as optional activities and lasted 2 weeks, 1 for binary exploitation and the other 1 for web exploitation.
