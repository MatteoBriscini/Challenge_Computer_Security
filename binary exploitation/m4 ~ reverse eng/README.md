# mission4
## Goal and instructions
Connect to bin.chall.necst.it port 22 via SSH as user [USERNAME]. You will find the files in /home/[USERNAME]/mission4.

Your goal is to obtain the flag by finding the right input that allows to exit the dark room.
## Code overview
Unlike all other challenges, "Dark Room" did not provide the C source file, but only the executable of the problem to exploit. To overcome this limitation it is necessary to analyze the executable file through a decompiler like Ghidra.
Analyzing the code it can be seen that the program has stored in its data portion:
- a starting position
- an exit position
- and a labyrinth.
  
Four letters on the keyboard (I, J, K, L) allow the player to move from the starting position to other valid positions. If the player hits a wall the program stops its execution, but if they reach the exit the program will print the output to the player's shell.

## Solution
To navigate the map of the labyrinth it is necessary to retrieve the starting position, the exit position, and the map from the executable or the de-compiled program. Once the data have been found it is necessary to visualize it in a human-readable way. We did it through several Python scripts:
- First, a parser that transforms the portion of the executable containing the data into a .txt or .csv file
- Then, another script to plot the map of the labyrinth and the position of the player.
- To further facilitate the process, the plot can be repeated at each movement of the player, to see the position of player after the moves that have already been performed.

Once the correct sequence of movements has been found it is sufficient to copy and paste in iside the program to obtain the flag.
