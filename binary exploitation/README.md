## Binary Exploitation

This folder contains the binary challenge exploitation methods.


## How to run

The command structure to be used to try to exploit all the challenges is as follows:
  ```bash
  python INPUT.py; cat - | env -i ABSOLUTE_PATH/missionI
  ```
  Where:
  - the **python** command allows you to run scripts to input to exploit challenges
    > **note:** if you do not want to use a script you can use:
      ```bash
      python -c "print 'WHAT_TO_INSERT'"
      ```
  - the **cat -** command waits for further input from the standard input.
  - the **env -i** command unsets the environment variable
  - the **ABSOLUTE_PATH/missionI** command run the executable file
